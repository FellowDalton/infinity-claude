It provides safe state operations with backup, validation, and history tracking.\n---\n\n# State Manager\n\nThis skill provides safe and reliable operations for managing the infinity-claude state system.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe state-manager skill enables reading and updating the system's state file with automatic backups, JSON validation, and history tracking. It ensures state integrity across continuity cycles.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nUse this skill when:\n- Reading current state values (cycle count, metrics, next actions, etc.)\n- Updating state values (progress, metrics, status)\n- Incrementing counters (tasks completed, cycles run)\n- Marking actions as complete\n- Getting a summary of current state\n- Need to safely modify state with automatic backups\n\n## Usage\n\nExecute the state-manager script from the project root:\n\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh <command> [args]\n```\n\n### Available Commands\n\n#### `summary`\nDisplay a formatted summary of the current state including:\n- Current cycle count\n- Metrics (tasks completed, quality score)\n- Next actions to be performed\n- Active blockers\n- Human intervention requirements\n\n**Example:**\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh summary\n```\n\n#### `get <key>`\nRetrieve a specific value from the state file. Supports nested keys using dot notation.\n\n**Examples:**\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh get cycleCount\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh get metrics.tasksCompleted\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh get nextActions[0].description\n```\n\n#### `set <key> <value>`\nSet a specific value in the state file. Automatically creates backups before modification.\n\n**Examples:**\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh set requiresHuman true\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh set metrics.qualityScore 98\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh set currentPhase implementation\n```\n\n#### `increment <key>`\nIncrement a numeric value in the state file. Useful for counters.\n\n**Examples:**\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh increment cycleCount\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh increment metrics.tasksCompleted\n```\n\n#### `complete <action-id>`\nMark a specific action in nextActions as completed and move it to completedActions.\n\n**Example:**\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh complete \"implement-user-auth\"\n```\n\n## State File Structure\n\nThe state file (`.claude/state/current.json`) contains:\n```json\n{\n  \"cycleCount\": 0,\n  \"lastRun\": \"timestamp\",\n  \"currentPhase\": \"string\",\n  \"requiresHuman\": false,\n  \"metrics\": {\n    \"tasksCompleted\": 0,\n    \"qualityScore\": 0\n  },\n  \"nextActions\": [],\n  \"completedActions\": [],\n  \"blockers\": []\n}\n```\n\n## Safety Features\n\n1. **Automatic Backups**: Every write operation creates a backup at `.claude/state/current.json.bak`\n2. **JSON Validation**: All operations validate JSON structure before and after modifications\n3. **History Tracking**: State changes are logged to `.claude/state/history.jsonl`\n4. **Atomic Operations**: Updates use temporary files to prevent corruption\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Read before write**: Always check current state before updating\n2. **Use increment for counters**: Safer than get-modify-set\n3. **Use complete for actions**: Properly tracks action lifecycle\n4. **Check validation**: Ensure operations succeed before proceeding\n5. **Prefer continuity-manager subagent**: For complex state updates, use the continuity-manager subagent which wraps this skill with higher-level logic\n\n## Integration with System\n\nThe state-manager integrates with:\n- Continuity cycles (read at start, update at end)\n- The continuity-manager subagent (uses this skill internally)\n- The monitor dashboard (displays state summary)\n- All agents (can read state for context)\n"

Useful for counters.\n\n**Examples:**\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh increment cycleCount\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh increment metrics.tasksCompleted\n```\n\n#### `complete <action-id>`\nMark a specific action in nextActions as completed and move it to completedActions.\n\n**Example:**\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh complete \"implement-user-auth\"\n```\n\n## State File Structure\n\nThe state file (`.claude/state/current.json`) contains:\n```json\n{\n  \"cycleCount\": 0,\n  \"lastRun\": \"timestamp\",\n  \"currentPhase\": \"string\",\n  \"requiresHuman\": false,\n  \"metrics\": {\n    \"tasksCompleted\": 0,\n    \"qualityScore\": 0\n  },\n  \"nextActions\": [],\n  \"completedActions\": [],\n  \"blockers\": []\n}\n```\n\n## Safety Features\n\n1. **Automatic Backups**: Every write operation creates a backup at `.claude/state/current.json.bak`\n2. **JSON Validation**: All operations validate JSON structure before and after modifications\n3. **History Tracking**: State changes are logged to `.claude/state/history.jsonl`\n4. **Atomic Operations**: Updates use temporary files to prevent corruption\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Read before write**: Always check current state before updating\n2. **Use increment for counters**: Safer than get-modify-set\n3. **Use complete for actions**: Properly tracks action lifecycle\n4. **Check validation**: Ensure operations succeed before proceeding\n5. **Prefer continuity-manager subagent**: For complex state updates, use the continuity-manager subagent which wraps this skill with higher-level logic\n\n## Integration with System\n\nThe state-manager integrates with:\n- Continuity cycles (read at start, update at end)\n- The continuity-manager subagent (uses this skill internally)\n- The monitor dashboard (displays state summary)\n- All agents (can read state for context)\n",

        "content": "# CLAUDE.md\n\nThis file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.\n\n## Project Overview\n\nA **self-evolving autonomous development system** where Claude builds applications continuously. The system runs every 30 minutes, maintains state between runs, and creates agents/tools as needed.\n\n**Core principle**: Quality-first development.

The system runs every 30 minutes, maintains state between runs, and creates agents/tools as needed.\n\n**Core principle**: Quality-first development. Code must pass all quality gates (score >95) before proceeding.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### First Time (Bootstrap)\nUse `/bootstrap` or read `.claude/docs/initialization.md`\n\n### Continuity Cycles\nUse `/continue` to run a manual cycle (simulates the 30-min automated runs)\n\n### Check Status\nUse `/monitor` to see current state, metrics, and next actions\n\n## Slash Commands\n\n- `/bootstrap` - Initialize system and start first cycle\n- `/continue` - Run manual continuity check\n- `/create-agent` - Create specialized agent interactively\n- `/monitor` - Display dashboard\n- `/quality-check` - Run all quality gates\n- `/swarm` - Deploy parallel Haiku swarm agents for focused tasks\n\n## Subagents\n\n- **continuity-manager** (`.claude/subagents/continuity-manager.md`) - Handles state updates, action planning, and cycle transitions\n\n### Swarm Agents (Haiku-powered)\nFor parallel, focused tasks, deploy **swarm agents** - lightweight Haiku-powered subagents that can run simultaneously:\n- Security scanning across multiple files\n- Code review of many small files\n- Parallel research tasks\n- Data gathering from multiple sources\n\nSee `.claude/docs/swarm-agents.md` for patterns and templates.\n\n## Skills\n\nSkills are modular packages in `.claude/skills/` that extend capabilities with specialized workflows:\n\n- **state-manager** - State file operations (`summary`, `get`, `set`, `increment`, `complete`)\n- **quality-validator** - Quality checks (`quick`, `precommit`, `full`)\n- **agent-spawner** - Agent creation (`interactive`, `list`, `info`)\n- **swarm-deployer** - Swarm deployment (`list`, `plan`, `deploy`, `history`)\n- **skill-creator** - Guide for creating new skills\n\nEach skill has a `SKILL.md` file describing usage and scripts in `scripts/` subdirectory.\n\nUsage: `bash .claude/skills/<skill-name>/scripts/<skill-name>.sh <command>`\n\n## State Management\n\n**Primary state**: `.claude/state/current.json`\n- Read at start of each cycle for context\n- Update at end with completed actions and next steps\n- Use `continuity-manager` subagent or `state-manager.sh` skill\n\n**Critical**: Always update state before finishing a session!\n\n## Quality Requirements\n\n- Quality score must stay >95\n- Test coverage must be >80%\n- Zero high/critical security vulnerabilities\n- Run checks: `bash .claude/skills/quality-validator/scripts/quality-validator.sh precommit`\n\nSee `.claude/docs/quality-framework.md` for complete requirements.\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\n.claude/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 commands/        # Slash command definitions\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 subagents/       # Subagent configurations\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 skills/          # Reusable executable tools\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts/         # Core automation (continuity, setup, etc.)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docs/            # Detailed documentation\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 state/           # State files (current.json, agents.json, etc.)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 memory/          # Persistent memory (decisions, learnings, best-practices)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 agents/          # Runtime agents (created as needed)\n```\n\n## Continuity Protocol\n\nEach 30-minute cycle:\n1.

        "content": "# Swarm Command\n\nDeploy parallel Haiku-powered swarm agents for focused, high-speed task execution.\n\n## Instructions\n\nYou are deploying a **swarm of Haiku agents** to execute parallel tasks efficiently.\n\n### Swarm Deployment Process\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Task**\n- Identify if the task can be parallelized\n- Break down into atomic, independent units\n- Determine appropriate swarm size (typically 10-50 agents)\n\n**Step 2: Design Swarm Strategy**\n- Choose swarm agent type (or create new one)\n- Define input for each agent\n- Design output schema for aggregation\n\n**Step 3: Deploy Swarm**\nUse the Task tool to launch multiple Haiku agents in parallel:\n\n```\nDeploy [N] Haiku agents to [task description].\n\nAgent type: [security-scanner | code-reviewer | doc-generator | custom]\nModel: Haiku\nInputs: [list of inputs, one per agent]\nOutput format: [structured format for aggregation]\n\nExample:\n- Agent 1: Review file1.js for security issues\n- Agent 2: Review file2.js for security issues\n- ...\n- Agent N: Review fileN.js for security issues\n```\n\n**Step 4: Aggregate Results**\nOnce all agents complete:\n- Collect structured outputs\n- Identify patterns and trends\n- Calculate aggregate metrics\n- Generate summary report\n- Plan next actions based on findings\n\n### Common Swarm Patterns\n\n**Security Audit Swarm**\n```\nTask: Audit 30 API endpoints\nSwarm size: 30 agents (1 per endpoint)\nAgent type: security-scanner\nOutput: Security issues by severity\nAggregation: Total issues, prioritized fix list\n```\n\n**Code Review Swarm**\n```\nTask: Review 50 files for code quality\nSwarm size: 50 agents (1 per file)\nAgent type: code-reviewer\nOutput: Quality score + issues\nAggregation: Average score, common issues\n```\n\n**Documentation Swarm**\n```\nTask: Generate docs for 20 modules\nSwarm size: 20 agents (1 per module)\nAgent type: doc-generator\nOutput: Markdown documentation\nAggregation: Combined docs, cross-references\n```\n\n**Research Swarm**\n```\nTask: Research best practices from 10 sources\nSwarm size: 10 agents (1 per source)\nAgent type: research-gatherer\nOutput: Key findings + recommendations\nAggregation: Deduplicated best practices list\n```\n\n### Swarm Agent Templates\n\nUse these or create custom ones in `.claude/subagents/swarm/`:\n\n**Available Templates:**\n- `security-scanner` - Check file for security issues\n- `code-reviewer` - Analyze code quality\n- `doc-generator` - Generate documentation\n- `test-analyzer` - Analyze test coverage\n- `dependency-checker` - Check dependencies\n\n**Custom Template Example:**\n```markdown\n# Custom Swarm Agent (Haiku)\n\n**Model**: Haiku\n**Purpose**: [Single focused task]\n**Input**: [What each agent receives]\n**Output**: [Structured format]\n\n## Instructions\n[Clear, focused instructions for single task]\n\n## Output Format\n{\n  \"input\": \"...\",\n  \"result\": {...},\n  \"metadata\": {...}\n}\n```\n\n### Deployment Options\n\n**Option 1: Quick Swarm** (using existing template)\n```\nUse the swarm skill:\nbash .claude/skills/swarm-deployer.sh deploy security-scanner \"src/**/*.js\"\n```\n\n**Option 2: Custom Swarm** (ad-hoc)\n```\nI need to deploy a swarm to [task].\n\nCreate [N] Haiku agents that each [specific task].\nInputs: [list]\nExpected output: [format]\n```\n\n**Option 3: Planned Swarm** (from state file)\n```\nExecute swarm action from state file:\nAction ID: swarm-001\nType: security-scanner\nCount: 30\nInputs: [from file list]\n```\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Keep Agents Focused**\n   - One task per agent\n   - Self-contained input\n   - Structured output\n\n2. **Batch Appropriately**\n   - Don't deploy 1000s at once\n   - Group in batches of 10-50\n   - Monitor resources\n\n3. **Design for Aggregation**\n   - Consistent output format\n   - Include metadata\n   - Easy to combine\n\n4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**\n   - Don't fail entire swarm for one failure\n   - Collect partial results\n   - Retry failed agents individually\n\n5. **Choose Right Model**\n   - Haiku: Simple, fast, parallel\n   - Sonnet: Orchestration, aggregation\n   - Don't use Opus for swarm agents\n\n### After Swarm Completes\n\n1. **Aggregate Results**\n   - Combine all outputs\n   - Calculate metrics\n   - Identify patterns\n\n2. **Generate Report**\n   - Summary statistics\n   - Key findings\n   - Prioritized actions\n\n3. **Update State**\n   - Mark swarm action as completed\n   - Add next actions based on findings\n   - Update quality metrics if applicable\n\n4. **Document Findings**\n   - Save report to appropriate location\n   - Update memory files if patterns discovered\n   - Log decision if new approach validated\n\n### Example Invocations\n\n**Security Audit:**\n```\nDeploy security audit swarm across src/ directory.\nUse security-scanner template.\nCheck for: SQL injection, XSS, auth issues.\nGenerate prioritized fix list.\n```\n\n**Code Quality:**\n```\nDeploy code review swarm for all files in PR #123.\nUse code-reviewer template.\nFocus on: complexity, duplication, best practices.\nCalculate average quality score.\n```\n\n**Documentation:**\n```\nDeploy doc generation swarm for all modules.\nUse doc-generator template.\nFormat: JSDoc/TSDoc.\nCombine into API documentation.\n```\n\n### Performance Expectations\n\n- **Serial (1 Sonnet)**: N tasks \u00d7 10s each\n- **Swarm (N Haiku)**: ~10-30 seconds total\n- **Cost**: Often less than 1 Sonnet call\n- **Quality**: High accuracy on focused tasks\n\n### Integration\n\nAdd swarm actions to state:\n```json\n{\n  \"nextActions\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"swarm-001\",\n      \"type\": \"swarm_deployment\",\n      \"priority\": \"high\",\n      \"action\": \"Deploy security swarm to audit all API endpoints\",\n      \"swarm\": {\n        \"template\": \"security-scanner\",\n        \"count\": 30,\n        \"model\": \"haiku\",\n        \"inputs\": [\"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", ...],\n        \"aggregation\": \"security-report\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Remember**: Swarms are a force multiplier. Use them for parallel, focused work. 30 tasks in 30 seconds instead of 30 minutes!\n\nFor detailed patterns and templates, see `.claude/docs/swarm-agents.md`\n",

Your job is to execute the solo dev's intent\u2014never to invent or overcomplicate.**\n\n---\n\n## The Mindset\n\n- **Only build what explicitly asks for.**\n- Never assume, add, or change features, infra, or logic without a clear request in the spec or ops doc.\n- Simplicity and clarity are your top priorities\u2014every line should be understandable by the solo dev at a glance.\n\n---\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### 1. **No Over-Engineering**\n\n- Do **not** introduce features, logs, collections, or automations unless directly specified.\n- Ignore \"industry best practices\" unless requests them for _this_ project.\n- Only automate (security, audits, recovery, etc.) when asked.\n\n### 2. **Full Transparency & Traceability**\n\n- Every function, data structure, and process must be easy for the solo dev to read, explain, and control.\n- No hidden abstractions, no unexplained dependencies.\n\n### 3. **You Are Not the Architect**\n\n- Agents do not initiate changes to the system's architecture, data model, or integrations.\n- Only generate new logic, infra, or tools if provides written specs or explicit instructions.\n- Your primary role: _implement, clarify, document._ Never decide.\n\n### 4. **Single Source of Truth**\n\n- Only act on requirements and ideas found in the project's designated ops doc (Notion, README, etc.).\n- If a change isn't documented there, do **not** propose or implement it.\n\n### 5. **SLC Standard \u2014 Simple, Lovable, Complete**\n\n- **Simple:**\\\n  Every proposal, solution, or code change should be as direct and minimal as possible.\\\n  If a feature can be built with less code, fewer files, or one clear function, that's always preferred.\\\n  Avoid configuration, abstraction, or patterns that the solo dev doesn't use or want.\n\n- **Lovable:**\\\n  Only build features or flows that the solo dev actually cares about, uses, or can explain the value of.\\\n  If you're unsure if something brings joy, utility, or clarity to the solo dev or end users\u2014ask before building.\n\n- **Complete:**\\\n  Every feature, flow, or proposal should be finished enough that it solves the _actual problem_ it was intended for\u2014no half-built endpoints, no \"future hooks,\" no unfinished UI.\\\n  Don't leave TODOs, dead code, or incomplete implementations unless you are specifically asked to scaffold something out.\n\n**Before you suggest or build anything, ask:**\\\n\n- Is this the simplest version?\\\n- Is this something the solo dev will love, use, or be proud to own?\\\n- Is it complete and shippable, or am I leaving work unfinished?\n\nIf you can't answer YES to all three, you must revise, simplify, or clarify before moving forward.\n\n### 6. **Reuse, Don't Reinvent**\n\n- Solo dev projects **prioritize using existing, proven solutions**\u2014frameworks, libraries, APIs, or patterns that already work\u2014unless there's a _clear, specific_ reason not to.\n- Do **not** suggest or start building custom tools, wrappers, or systems when a solid, well-supported option exists.\n- Only rebuild from scratch if requests it _and_ there's a documented need that existing solutions cannot address.\n- Saving time and reducing maintenance is part of the solo dev's survival\u2014respect that.\n\n---\n\n## Strict Protocols\n\n- **Reject all extra code, dependencies, or automations** unless directly specified and justified in the ops doc.\n- **Never make changes for hypothetical or \"future proofing\" reasons.**\n- **If the solo dev does not understand or cannot explain what you propose, you must remove or revise it.**\n- **Always check with the solo dev before taking any creative or architectural initiative.**\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## Final Note\n\nYou're not building for a boardroom.\\\nThe Solo Dev Mindset is about _staying lean, owning every inch of the stack, and shipping confidently._\n\n**If you don't need it, don't build it.**\\\n**If you didn't ask for it, delete it.**\\\n**If you can't explain it, you don't own it.**\n\nThis doc isn't a suggestion.\\\nIt's your north star.\\\nWhenever some new tool, agent, or \"best practice\" starts creeping in,\\\npull this out, read it once, and remind yourself: **Own it.**\n",

        "content": "# CLAUDE.md\n\nThis file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.\n\n## Project Overview\n\nA **self-evolving autonomous development system** where Claude builds applications continuously. The system runs every 30 minutes, maintains state between runs, and creates agents/tools as needed.\n\n**Core principle**: Quality-first development. Code must pass all quality gates (score >95) before proceeding.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### First Time (Bootstrap)\nUse `/bootstrap` or read `.claude/docs/initialization.md`\n\n### Continuity Cycles\nUse `/continue` to run a manual cycle (simulates the 30-min automated runs)\n\n### Check Status\nUse `/monitor` to see current state, metrics, and next actions\n\n## Slash Commands\n\n- `/bootstrap` - Initialize system and start first cycle\n- `/continue` - Run manual continuity check\n- `/create-agent` - Create specialized agent interactively\n- `/monitor` - Display dashboard\n- `/quality-check` - Run all quality gates\n- `/swarm` - Deploy parallel Haiku swarm agents for focused tasks\n\n## Subagents\n\n- **continuity-manager** (`.claude/subagents/continuity-manager.md`) - Handles state updates, action planning, and cycle transitions\n\n### Swarm Agents (Haiku-powered)\nFor parallel, focused tasks, deploy **swarm agents** - lightweight Haiku-powered subagents that can run simultaneously:\n- Security scanning across multiple files\n- Code review of many small files\n- Parallel research tasks\n- Data gathering from multiple sources\n\nSee `.claude/docs/swarm-agents.md` for patterns and templates.\n\n## Skills\n\nSkills are modular packages in `.claude/skills/` that extend capabilities with specialized workflows:\n\n- **state-manager** - State file operations (`summary`, `get`, `set`, `increment`, `complete`)\n- **quality-validator** - Quality checks (`quick`, `precommit`, `full`)\n- **agent-spawner** - Agent creation (`interactive`, `list`, `info`)\n- **swarm-deployer** - Swarm deployment (`list`, `plan`, `deploy`, `history`)\n- **skill-creator** - Guide for creating new skills\n\nEach skill has a `SKILL.md` file describing usage and scripts in `scripts/` subdirectory.\n\nUsage: `bash .claude/skills/<skill-name>/scripts/<skill-name>.sh <command>`\n\n## State Management\n\n**Primary state**: `.claude/state/current.json`\n- Read at start of each cycle for context\n- Update at end with completed actions and next steps\n- Use `continuity-manager` subagent or `state-manager.sh` skill\n\n**Critical**: Always update state before finishing a session!\n\n## Quality Requirements\n\n- Quality score must stay >95\n- Test coverage must be >80%\n- Zero high/critical security vulnerabilities\n- Run checks: `bash .claude/skills/quality-validator/scripts/quality-validator.sh precommit`\n\nSee `.claude/docs/quality-framework.md` for complete requirements.\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\n.claude/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 commands/        # Slash command definitions\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 subagents/       # Subagent configurations\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 skills/          # Reusable executable tools\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts/         # Core automation (continuity, setup, etc.)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docs/            # Detailed documentation\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 state/           # State files (current.json, agents.json, etc.)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 memory/          # Persistent memory (decisions, learnings, best-practices)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 agents/          # Runtime agents (created as needed)\n```\n\n## Continuity Protocol\n\nEach 30-minute cycle:\n1. Read `.claude/state/current.json`\n2. Execute `nextActions` by priority\n3. Update state with progress\n4. Plan next actions\n5. Set `requiresHuman: true` only if blocked\n\n**Key**: Always plan next actions before finishing to ensure continuity.\n\n## Common Operations\n\n```bash\n# State operations\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh summary\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh get cycleCount\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh increment metrics.tasksCompleted\n\n# Quality checks\nbash .claude/skills/quality-validator/scripts/quality-validator.sh quick      # Fast (lint + types)\nbash .claude/skills/quality-validator/scripts/quality-validator.sh precommit  # Pre-commit\nbash .claude/skills/quality-validator/scripts/quality-validator.sh full       # All gates\n\n# Agent management\nbash .claude/skills/agent-spawner/scripts/agent-spawner.sh interactive\nbash .claude/skills/agent-spawner/scripts/agent-spawner.sh list\n\n# Swarm deployment\nbash .claude/skills/swarm-deployer/scripts/swarm-deployer.sh plan security-scanner \"src/**/*.js\"\nbash .claude/skills/swarm-deployer/scripts/swarm-deployer.sh deploy security-scanner \"src/**/*.js\"\n```\n\n## Memory Files\n\nUpdate these to maintain context:\n- `.claude/memory/architecture.md` - System design decisions\n- `.claude/memory/decisions.md` - Decision log with rationale\n- `.claude/memory/learnings.md` - What worked/didn't work\n- `.claude/memory/best-practices.md` - Researched best practices\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Use slash commands** for structured workflows\n2. **Invoke subagents** for specialized tasks (state management, etc.)\n3. **Leverage skills** for common operations\n4. **Research before coding** - search best practices, document findings\n5. **Quality first** - validate everything, maintain score >95\n6. **Update state** - use `continuity-manager` before finishing\n7. **Document decisions** - future instances need context\n\n## Detailed Documentation\n\n- **Initialization**: `.claude/docs/initialization.md`\n- **Bootstrap**: `.claude/docs/bootstrap.md`\n- **Quick Start**: `.claude/docs/quick-start.md`\n- **Quality Framework**: `.claude/docs/quality-framework.md`\n- **Quality Checklist**: `.claude/docs/quality-checklist.md`\n- **Swarm Agents**: `.claude/docs/swarm-agents.md` (Haiku-powered parallel agents)\n- **Full README**: `README.md`\n\n## Emergency\n\n**If stuck 3+ cycles**: Create helper agent or tool\n**If quality <80**: STOP, run full quality check, fix all issues\n**If blocked**: Set `requiresHuman: true` and document in `blockers`\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Task | Command |\n|------|---------|\n| Start cycle | `/continue` |\n| Check status | `/monitor` |\n| Update state | Invoke `continuity-manager` |\n| Quality check | `/quality-check` |\n| Create agent | `/create-agent` |\n| View state | `bash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh summary` |\n\n---\n\n**Remember**: This system depends on continuity. Always update state with next actions before finishing!\n",

Your job is to execute the solo dev's intent\u2014never to invent or overcomplicate.**\n\n---\n\n## The Mindset\n\n- **Only build what explicitly asks for.**\n- Never assume, add, or change features, infra, or logic without a clear request in the spec or ops doc.\n- Simplicity and clarity are your top priorities\u2014every line should be understandable by the solo dev at a glance.\n\n---\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### 1. **No Over-Engineering**\n\n- Do **not** introduce features, logs, collections, or automations unless directly specified.\n- Ignore \"industry best practices\" unless requests them for _this_ project.\n- Only automate (security, audits, recovery, etc.) when asked.\n\n### 2. **Full Transparency & Traceability**\n\n- Every function, data structure, and process must be easy for the solo dev to read, explain, and control.\n- No hidden abstractions, no unexplained dependencies.\n\n### 3. **You Are Not the Architect**\n\n- Agents do not initiate changes to the system's architecture, data model, or integrations.\n- Only generate new logic, infra, or tools if provides written specs or explicit instructions.\n- Your primary role: _implement, clarify, document._ Never decide.\n\n### 4. **Single Source of Truth**\n\n- Only act on requirements and ideas found in the project's designated ops doc (Notion, README, etc.).\n- If a change isn't documented there, do **not** propose or implement it.\n\n### 5. **SLC Standard \u2014 Simple, Lovable, Complete**\n\n- **Simple:**\\\n  Every proposal, solution, or code change should be as direct and minimal as possible.\\\n  If a feature can be built with less code, fewer files, or one clear function, that's always preferred.\\\n  Avoid configuration, abstraction, or patterns that the solo dev doesn't use or want.\n\n- **Lovable:**\\\n  Only build features or flows that the solo dev actually cares about, uses, or can explain the value of.\\\n  If you're unsure if something brings joy, utility, or clarity to the solo dev or end users\u2014ask before building.\n\n- **Complete:**\\\n  Every feature, flow, or proposal should be finished enough that it solves the _actual problem_ it was intended for\u2014no half-built endpoints, no \"future hooks,\" no unfinished UI.\\\n  Don't leave TODOs, dead code, or incomplete implementations unless you are specifically asked to scaffold something out.\n\n**Before you suggest or build anything, ask:**\\\n\n- Is this the simplest version?\\\n- Is this something the solo dev will love, use, or be proud to own?\\\n- Is it complete and shippable, or am I leaving work unfinished?\n\nIf you can't answer YES to all three, you must revise, simplify, or clarify before moving forward.\n\n### 6. **Reuse, Don't Reinvent**\n\n- Solo dev projects **prioritize using existing, proven solutions**\u2014frameworks, libraries, APIs, or patterns that already work\u2014unless there's a _clear, specific_ reason not to.\n- Do **not** suggest or start building custom tools, wrappers, or systems when a solid, well-supported option exists.\n- Only rebuild from scratch if requests it _and_ there's a documented need that existing solutions cannot address.\n- Saving time and reducing maintenance is part of the solo dev's survival\u2014respect that.\n\n---\n\n## Strict Protocols\n\n- **Reject all extra code, dependencies, or automations** unless directly specified and justified in the ops doc.\n- **Never make changes for hypothetical or \"future proofing\" reasons.**\n- **If the solo dev does not understand or cannot explain what you propose, you must remove or revise it.**\n- **Always check with the solo dev before taking any creative or architectural initiative.**\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## Final Note\n\nYou're not building for a boardroom.\\\nThe Solo Dev Mindset is about _staying lean, owning every inch of the stack, and shipping confidently._\n\n**If you don't need it, don't build it.**\\\n**If you didn't ask for it, delete it.**\\\n**If you can't explain it, you don't own it.**\n\nThis doc isn't a suggestion.\\\nIt's your north star.\\\nWhenever some new tool, agent, or \"best practice\" starts creeping in,\\\npull this out, read it once, and remind yourself: **Own it.**\n",

Your job is to execute the solo dev's intent\u2014never to invent or overcomplicate.**\n\n---\n\n## The Mindset\n\n- **Only build what explicitly asks for.**\n- Never assume, add, or change features, infra, or logic without a clear request in the spec or ops doc.\n- Simplicity and clarity are your top priorities\u2014every line should be understandable by the solo dev at a glance.\n\n---\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### 1. **No Over-Engineering**\n\n- Do **not** introduce features, logs, collections, or automations unless directly specified.\n- Ignore \"industry best practices\" unless requests them for _this_ project.\n- Only automate (security, audits, recovery, etc.) when asked.\n\n### 2. **Full Transparency & Traceability**\n\n- Every function, data structure, and process must be easy for the solo dev to read, explain, and control.\n- No hidden abstractions, no unexplained dependencies.\n\n### 3. **You Are Not the Architect**\n\n- Agents do not initiate changes to the system's architecture, data model, or integrations.\n- Only generate new logic, infra, or tools if provides written specs or explicit instructions.\n- Your primary role: _implement, clarify, document._ Never decide.\n\n### 4. **Single Source of Truth**\n\n- Only act on requirements and ideas found in the project's designated ops doc (Notion, README, etc.).\n- If a change isn't documented there, do **not** propose or implement it.\n\n### 5. **SLC Standard \u2014 Simple, Lovable, Complete**\n\n- **Simple:**\\\n  Every proposal, solution, or code change should be as direct and minimal as possible.\\\n  If a feature can be built with less code, fewer files, or one clear function, that's always preferred.\\\n  Avoid configuration, abstraction, or patterns that the solo dev doesn't use or want.\n\n- **Lovable:**\\\n  Only build features or flows that the solo dev actually cares about, uses, or can explain the value of.\\\n  If you're unsure if something brings joy, utility, or clarity to the solo dev or end users\u2014ask before building.\n\n- **Complete:**\\\n  Every feature, flow, or proposal should be finished enough that it solves the _actual problem_ it was intended for\u2014no half-built endpoints, no \"future hooks,\" no unfinished UI.\\\n  Don't leave TODOs, dead code, or incomplete implementations unless you are specifically asked to scaffold something out.\n\n**Before you suggest or build anything, ask:**\\\n\n- Is this the simplest version?\\\n- Is this something the solo dev will love, use, or be proud to own?\\\n- Is it complete and shippable, or am I leaving work unfinished?\n\nIf you can't answer YES to all three, you must revise, simplify, or clarify before moving forward.\n\n### 6. **Reuse, Don't Reinvent**\n\n- Solo dev projects **prioritize using existing, proven solutions**\u2014frameworks, libraries, APIs, or patterns that already work\u2014unless there's a _clear, specific_ reason not to.\n- Do **not** suggest or start building custom tools, wrappers, or systems when a solid, well-supported option exists.\n- Only rebuild from scratch if requests it _and_ there's a documented need that existing solutions cannot address.\n- Saving time and reducing maintenance is part of the solo dev's survival\u2014respect that.\n\n---\n\n## Strict Protocols\n\n- **Reject all extra code, dependencies, or automations** unless directly specified and justified in the ops doc.\n- **Never make changes for hypothetical or \"future proofing\" reasons.**\n- **If the solo dev does not understand or cannot explain what you propose, you must remove or revise it.**\n- **Always check with the solo dev before taking any creative or architectural initiative.**\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## Final Note\n\nYou're not building for a boardroom.\\\nThe Solo Dev Mindset is about _staying lean, owning every inch of the stack, and shipping confidently._\n\n**If you don't need it, don't build it.**\\\n**If you didn't ask for it, delete it.**\\\n**If you can't explain it, you don't own it.**\n\nThis doc isn't a suggestion.\\\nIt's your north star.\\\nWhenever some new tool, agent, or \"best practice\" starts creeping in,\\\npull this out, read it once, and remind yourself: **Own it.**\n",

Code must pass all quality gates (score >95) before proceeding.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### First Time (Bootstrap)\nUse `/bootstrap` or read `.claude/docs/initialization.md`\n\n### Continuity Cycles\nUse `/continue` to run a manual cycle (simulates the 30-min automated runs)\n\n### Check Status\nUse `/monitor` to see current state, metrics, and next actions\n\n## Slash Commands\n\n- `/bootstrap` - Initialize system and start first cycle\n- `/continue` - Run manual continuity check\n- `/create-agent` - Create specialized agent interactively\n- `/monitor` - Display dashboard\n- `/quality-check` - Run all quality gates\n- `/swarm` - Deploy parallel Haiku swarm agents for focused tasks\n\n## Subagents\n\n- **continuity-manager** (`.claude/subagents/continuity-manager.md`) - Handles state updates, action planning, and cycle transitions\n\n### Swarm Agents (Haiku-powered)\nFor parallel, focused tasks, deploy **swarm agents** - lightweight Haiku-powered subagents that can run simultaneously:\n- Security scanning across multiple files\n- Code review of many small files\n- Parallel research tasks\n- Data gathering from multiple sources\n\nSee `.claude/docs/swarm-agents.md` for patterns and templates.\n\n## Skills\n\nSkills are modular packages in `.claude/skills/` that extend capabilities with specialized workflows:\n\n- **state-manager** - State file operations (`summary`, `get`, `set`, `increment`, `complete`)\n- **quality-validator** - Quality checks (`quick`, `precommit`, `full`)\n- **agent-spawner** - Agent creation (`interactive`, `list`, `info`)\n- **swarm-deployer** - Swarm deployment (`list`, `plan`, `deploy`, `history`)\n- **skill-creator** - Guide for creating new skills\n\nEach skill has a `SKILL.md` file describing usage and scripts in `scripts/` subdirectory.\n\nUsage: `bash .claude/skills/<skill-name>/scripts/<skill-name>.sh <command>`\n\n## State Management\n\n**Primary state**: `.claude/state/current.json`\n- Read at start of each cycle for context\n- Update at end with completed actions and next steps\n- Use `continuity-manager` subagent or `state-manager.sh` skill\n\n**Critical**: Always update state before finishing a session!\n\n## Quality Requirements\n\n- Quality score must stay >95\n- Test coverage must be >80%\n- Zero high/critical security vulnerabilities\n- Run checks: `bash .claude/skills/quality-validator/scripts/quality-validator.sh precommit`\n\nSee `.claude/docs/quality-framework.md` for complete requirements.\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\n.claude/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 commands/        # Slash command definitions\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 subagents/       # Subagent configurations\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 skills/          # Reusable executable tools\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts/         # Core automation (continuity, setup, etc.)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docs/            # Detailed documentation\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 state/           # State files (current.json, agents.json, etc.)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 memory/          # Persistent memory (decisions, learnings, best-practices)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 agents/          # Runtime agents (created as needed)\n```\n\n## Continuity Protocol\n\nEach 30-minute cycle:\n1.

Code must pass all quality gates (score >95) before proceeding.\n\n**Governance**: All system behavior subject to `.claude/MINDSET.md` principles.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### First Time (Bootstrap)\nUse `/bootstrap` or read `.claude/docs/initialization.md`\n\n### Continuity Cycles\nUse `/continue` to run a manual cycle (simulates the 30-min automated runs)\n\n### Check Status\nUse `/monitor` to see current state, metrics, and next actions\n\n## Slash Commands\n\n- `/bootstrap` - Initialize system and start first cycle\n- `/continue` - Run manual continuity check\n- `/create-agent` - Create specialized agent interactively\n- `/monitor` - Display dashboard\n- `/quality-check` - Run all quality gates\n- `/swarm` - Deploy parallel Haiku swarm agents for focused tasks\n\n## Subagents\n\n- **continuity-manager** (`.claude/subagents/continuity-manager.md`) - Handles state updates, action planning, and cycle transitions\n\n### Swarm Agents (Haiku-powered)\nFor parallel, focused tasks, deploy **swarm agents** - lightweight Haiku-powered subagents that can run simultaneously:\n- Security scanning across multiple files\n- Code review of many small files\n- Parallel research tasks\n- Data gathering from multiple sources\n\nSee `.claude/docs/swarm-agents.md` for patterns and templates.\n\n## Skills\n\nSkills are modular packages in `.claude/skills/` that extend capabilities with specialized workflows:\n\n- **state-manager** - State file operations (`summary`, `get`, `set`, `increment`, `complete`)\n- **quality-validator** - Quality checks (`quick`, `precommit`, `full`)\n- **agent-spawner** - Agent creation (`interactive`, `list`, `info`)\n- **swarm-deployer** - Swarm deployment (`list`, `plan`, `deploy`, `history`)\n- **skill-creator** - Guide for creating new skills\n\nEach skill has a `SKILL.md` file describing usage and scripts in `scripts/` subdirectory.\n\nUsage: `bash .claude/skills/<skill-name>/scripts/<skill-name>.sh <command>`\n\n## State Management\n\n**Primary state**: `.claude/state/current.json`\n- Read at start of each cycle for context\n- Update at end with completed actions and next steps\n- Use `continuity-manager` subagent or `state-manager.sh` skill\n\n**Critical**: Always update state before finishing a session!\n\n## Quality Requirements\n\n- Quality score must stay >95\n- Test coverage must be >80%\n- Zero high/critical security vulnerabilities\n- Run checks: `bash .claude/skills/quality-validator/scripts/quality-validator.sh precommit`\n\nSee `.claude/docs/quality-framework.md` for complete requirements.\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\n.claude/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 commands/        # Slash command definitions\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 subagents/       # Subagent configurations\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 skills/          # Reusable executable tools\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts/         # Core automation (continuity, setup, etc.)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docs/            # Detailed documentation\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 state/           # State files (current.json, agents.json, etc.)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 memory/          # Persistent memory (decisions, learnings, best-practices)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 agents/          # Runtime agents (created as needed)\n```\n\n## Continuity Protocol\n\nEach 30-minute cycle:\n1. Read `.claude/state/current.json`\n2. Execute `nextActions` by priority\n3. Update state with progress\n4. Plan next actions\n5. Set `requiresHuman: true` only if blocked\n\n**Key**: Always plan next actions before finishing to ensure continuity.\n\n## Common Operations\n\n```bash\n# State operations\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh summary\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh get cycleCount\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh increment metrics.tasksCompleted\n\n# Quality checks\nbash .claude/skills/quality-validator/scripts/quality-validator.sh quick      # Fast (lint + types)\nbash .claude/skills/quality-validator/scripts/quality-validator.sh precommit  # Pre-commit\nbash .claude/skills/quality-validator/scripts/quality-validator.sh full       # All gates\n\n# Agent management\nbash .claude/skills/agent-spawner/scripts/agent-spawner.sh interactive\nbash .claude/skills/agent-spawner/scripts/agent-spawner.sh list\n\n# Swarm deployment\nbash .claude/skills/swarm-deployer/scripts/swarm-deployer.sh plan security-scanner \"src/**/*.js\"\nbash .claude/skills/swarm-deployer/scripts/swarm-deployer.sh deploy security-scanner \"src/**/*.js\"\n```\n\n## Memory Files\n\nUpdate these to maintain context:\n- `.claude/memory/architecture.md` - System design decisions\n- `.claude/memory/decisions.md` - Decision log with rationale\n- `.claude/memory/learnings.md` - What worked/didn't work\n- `.claude/memory/best-practices.md` - Researched best practices\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Use slash commands** for structured workflows\n2. **Invoke subagents** for specialized tasks (state management, etc.)\n3. **Leverage skills** for common operations\n4. **Research before coding** - search best practices, document findings\n5. **Quality first** - validate everything, maintain score >95\n6. **Update state** - use `continuity-manager` before finishing\n7. **Document decisions** - future instances need context\n\n## Detailed Documentation\n\n- **Initialization**: `.claude/docs/initialization.md`\n- **Bootstrap**: `.claude/docs/bootstrap.md`\n- **Quick Start**: `.claude/docs/quick-start.md`\n- **Quality Framework**: `.claude/docs/quality-framework.md`\n- **Quality Checklist**: `.claude/docs/quality-checklist.md`\n- **Swarm Agents**: `.claude/docs/swarm-agents.md` (Haiku-powered parallel agents)\n- **Full README**: `README.md`\n\n## Emergency\n\n**If stuck 3+ cycles**: Create helper agent or tool\n**If quality <80**: STOP, run full quality check, fix all issues\n**If blocked**: Set `requiresHuman: true` and document in `blockers`\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Task | Command |\n|------|---------|\n| Start cycle | `/continue` |\n| Check status | `/monitor` |\n| Update state | Invoke `continuity-manager` |\n| Quality check | `/quality-check` |\n| Create agent | `/create-agent` |\n| View state | `bash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh summary` |\n\n---\n\n**Remember**: This system depends on continuity.

State Management (`.claude/state/current.json`)\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned\n**Reason**:\n- Solves explicit need (continuity across sessions)\n- Simple JSON format (transparent, inspectable)\n- Required for autonomous cycles (you explicitly want this)\n- No abstraction - just read/write JSON\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep as-is\n\n### 2. State Manager Skill\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned\n**Reason**:\n- Simple bash script wrapping jq commands\n- Prevents manual JSON editing errors\n- Every function is understandable at a glance\n- Reuses existing tool (jq) instead of custom parser\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep as-is\n\n### 3. Quality Validator Skill\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned\n**Reason**:\n- Enforces standards you explicitly set (score >95)\n- Reuses standard tools (eslint, pylint, jest, pytest)\n- No custom validation logic, just orchestration\n- Solves real need (prevent bad code from being committed)\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep as-is\n\n### 4. Slash Commands\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned\n**Reason**:\n- Simple markdown files with instructions\n- Convenience for workflows you perform repeatedly\n- Easy to add/remove (just a .md file)\n- No magic - Claude reads and follows instructions\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep as-is\n\n### 5. Agent Spawner Skill\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned\n**Reason**:\n- Interactive wizard (asks questions, you answer)\n- Creates simple agent.md files\n- Validates naming to prevent errors\n- Only runs when you explicitly invoke it\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep as-is\n\n### 6. Skills Structure (Anthropic Standard)\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned\n**Reason**:\n- Reuses proven pattern (not reinventing)\n- Simple: SKILL.md + scripts folder\n- Transparent - all files readable\n- Follows \"Reuse, Don't Reinvent\" principle\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep as-is\n\n### 7. Git Integration\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned\n**Reason**:\n- Uses standard git commands\n- Only commits when you explicitly request\n- No custom wrappers or abstractions\n- Safety checks (don't commit secrets, etc.)\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep as-is\n\n### 8.

README.md\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned\n**Reason**:\n- Standard project documentation\n- Explains what the system is/does\n- Helps future-you understand the project\n- No over-documentation\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep as-is\n\n---\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Questionable Features\n\nThese features might need simplification or better justification:\n\n### 1. Swarm Deployer Skill\n**Status**: \u26a0\ufe0f Questionable\n**Issues**:\n- Complex feature (parallel Haiku agents)\n- Adds significant conceptual overhead\n- Might be premature optimization\n\n**Questions to answer**:\n- Have you actually used swarms more than once?\n- Could you achieve same results with simpler sequential processing?\n- Is the complexity worth the speed gain?\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- **If used regularly**: Keep but document concrete use cases\n- **If rarely used**: Remove and recreate when genuinely needed\n- **If never used**: Delete immediately\n\n### 2. Multiple Subagent Files\n**Status**: \u26a0\ufe0f Questionable\n**Issues**:\n- How many subagents exist?\n- Are they all actively used?\n- Is there overlap in responsibilities?\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- Audit `.claude/subagents/` directory\n- Delete any subagent not used in last 5 sessions\n- Consider consolidating overlapping subagents\n\n### 3. Swarm Templates (`.claude/subagents/swarm/`)\n**Status**: \u26a0\ufe0f Questionable\n**Issues**:\n- Are these templates actually used?\n- Do they follow MINDSET.md (or are they speculative)?\n- Are they maintained or outdated?\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- Delete unused templates\n- Only keep templates with proven use cases\n- Create new ones only when needed (not preemptively)\n\n### 4. History Files (`.claude/state/history.jsonl`)\n**Status**: \u26a0\ufe0f Questionable\n**Issues**:\n- Is history actually reviewed?\n- Does it accumulate noise over time?\n- Is it necessary for continuity or just \"nice to have\"?\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- **If used for debugging**: Keep with size limits (rolling window)\n- **If never reviewed**: Delete - state file is sufficient\n\n### 5. `.claude/agents/` Runtime Agents\n**Status**: \u26a0\ufe0f Questionable\n**Issues**:\n- Are these created automatically or manually?\n- How many exist?\n- Are they cleaned up after use?\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- Audit directory - delete stale agents\n- Only create agents when explicitly needed\n- Add cleanup mechanism (delete agents older than N days)\n\n### 6. Multiple Documentation Files\n**Status**: \u26a0\ufe0f Questionable\n**Issues**:\n- `.claude/docs/` has many files\n- Is there duplication between docs?\n- Are all docs current and accurate?\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- Consolidate overlapping docs\n- Delete outdated docs\n- Keep only: quick-start.md, quality-framework.md, design-philosophy.md\n\n---\n\n## \u274c Violations\n\nThese features violate MINDSET.md and should be simplified/removed:\n\n### 1. Automated 30-Minute Cycles (if implemented)\n**Status**: \u274c Violation\n**Issues**:\n- MINDSET.md says \"Only build what explicitly asked for\"\n- Autonomous cycles without approval violate \"You Are Not the Architect\"\n- Could make changes you don't want\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- **If automated cycles are running**: DISABLE immediately\n- **If just planned**: Keep as manual `/continue` only\n- Autonomous cycles should require explicit enable flag + very clear boundaries\n\n**Exception**: If cycles only read/analyze (never write), and you explicitly want this, then okay\n\n### 2. Any \"Future Hooks\" or Unused Abstract Patterns\n**Status**: \u274c Violation\n**Issues**:\n- MINDSET.md explicitly forbids \"future proofing\"\n- Empty functions/classes/interfaces waiting to be filled\n- Abstraction layers with only one implementation\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- Search codebase for TODO comments\n- Delete any \"hooks for future features\"\n- Remove abstractions used in only one place\n- Simplify to concrete, working code only\n\n---\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Immediate (Do Now)\n1. \u2705 Move MINDSET.md to `.claude/` (already done)\n2. \u2705 Add supremacy clause to MINDSET.md (already done)\n3. \u2705 Update CLAUDE.md header (already done)\n4. \u2705 Create design-philosophy.md (already done)\n5. \u274c **Verify**: Are automated 30-min cycles running? If yes, disable.\n6. \u274c **Audit**: Check for TODO comments and future hooks \u2192 Delete\n\n### Short Term (This Week)\n1. Review `.claude/subagents/` - delete unused subagents\n2. Review `.claude/docs/` - consolidate overlapping docs\n3. Audit swarm-deployer - justify or remove\n4. Check `.claude/agents/` - add cleanup if needed\n5. Review memory files - delete stale content\n\n### Ongoing (Each Session)\n1. Before adding feature: Check MINDSET.md compliance\n2. After completing task: Delete any temporary files/agents\n3. Weekly: Review state file for cruft\n4. Monthly: Re-audit system against MINDSET.md\n\n---\n\n## Compliance Checklist\n\nBefore adding any new feature, verify:\n\n- [ ] Feature solves explicit, current need (not hypothetical)\n- [ ] Implementation is simplest possible version\n- [ ] Uses existing tools where available (doesn't reinvent)\n- [ ] Code is <200 lines and understandable at a glance\n- [ ] No abstractions unless used 3+ places\n- [ ] No configuration files for simple behavior\n- [ ] Feature can be deleted in <5 minutes if not needed\n- [ ] You can explain it to someone in <1 minute\n- [ ] It aligns with SLC (Simple, Lovable, Complete)\n\n**If any checkbox is unchecked, don't build the feature.**\n\n---\n\n## Review Schedule\n\n- **Daily**: Check for accumulating cruft (temp files, logs)\n- **Weekly**: Review new features against MINDSET.md\n- **Monthly**: Full system audit using this checklist\n- **Quarterly**: Memory file review and cleanup\n\nNext scheduled audit: 2025-11-28\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\nThis audit is a living document. Update it as:\n- New features are added\n- Features are removed\n- Violations are discovered\n- System evolves\n\n**Remember**: The goal isn't perfection, it's maintaining Solo Dev Mindset principles while building useful tools.\n"
