It provides safe state operations with backup, validation, and history tracking.\n---\n\n# State Manager\n\nThis skill provides safe and reliable operations for managing the infinity-claude state system.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe state-manager skill enables reading and updating the system's state file with automatic backups, JSON validation, and history tracking. It ensures state integrity across continuity cycles.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nUse this skill when:\n- Reading current state values (cycle count, metrics, next actions, etc.)\n- Updating state values (progress, metrics, status)\n- Incrementing counters (tasks completed, cycles run)\n- Marking actions as complete\n- Getting a summary of current state\n- Need to safely modify state with automatic backups\n\n## Usage\n\nExecute the state-manager script from the project root:\n\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh <command> [args]\n```\n\n### Available Commands\n\n#### `summary`\nDisplay a formatted summary of the current state including:\n- Current cycle count\n- Metrics (tasks completed, quality score)\n- Next actions to be performed\n- Active blockers\n- Human intervention requirements\n\n**Example:**\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh summary\n```\n\n#### `get <key>`\nRetrieve a specific value from the state file. Supports nested keys using dot notation.\n\n**Examples:**\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh get cycleCount\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh get metrics.tasksCompleted\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh get nextActions[0].description\n```\n\n#### `set <key> <value>`\nSet a specific value in the state file. Automatically creates backups before modification.\n\n**Examples:**\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh set requiresHuman true\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh set metrics.qualityScore 98\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh set currentPhase implementation\n```\n\n#### `increment <key>`\nIncrement a numeric value in the state file. Useful for counters.\n\n**Examples:**\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh increment cycleCount\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh increment metrics.tasksCompleted\n```\n\n#### `complete <action-id>`\nMark a specific action in nextActions as completed and move it to completedActions.\n\n**Example:**\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/state-manager/scripts/state-manager.sh complete \"implement-user-auth\"\n```\n\n## State File Structure\n\nThe state file (`.claude/state/current.json`) contains:\n```json\n{\n  \"cycleCount\": 0,\n  \"lastRun\": \"timestamp\",\n  \"currentPhase\": \"string\",\n  \"requiresHuman\": false,\n  \"metrics\": {\n    \"tasksCompleted\": 0,\n    \"qualityScore\": 0\n  },\n  \"nextActions\": [],\n  \"completedActions\": [],\n  \"blockers\": []\n}\n```\n\n## Safety Features\n\n1. **Automatic Backups**: Every write operation creates a backup at `.claude/state/current.json.bak`\n2. **JSON Validation**: All operations validate JSON structure before and after modifications\n3. **History Tracking**: State changes are logged to `.claude/state/history.jsonl`\n4. **Atomic Operations**: Updates use temporary files to prevent corruption\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Read before write**: Always check current state before updating\n2. **Use increment for counters**: Safer than get-modify-set\n3. **Use complete for actions**: Properly tracks action lifecycle\n4. **Check validation**: Ensure operations succeed before proceeding\n5. **Prefer continuity-manager subagent**: For complex state updates, use the continuity-manager subagent which wraps this skill with higher-level logic\n\n## Integration with System\n\nThe state-manager integrates with:\n- Continuity cycles (read at start, update at end)\n- The continuity-manager subagent (uses this skill internally)\n- The monitor dashboard (displays state summary)\n- All agents (can read state for context)\n"

It ensures code meets quality gate requirements (score >95).\n---\n\n# Quality Validator\n\nThis skill provides comprehensive quality checking functionality for the infinity-claude system.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe quality-validator skill runs various quality checks on the codebase and reports results with scores. It enforces the quality-first principle by ensuring all code meets minimum quality standards before proceeding.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nUse this skill when:\n- Before committing code changes\n- After implementing new features\n- To verify quality score is above threshold (>95)\n- Diagnosing quality issues\n- Running specific quality gates (lint, tests, security, etc.)\n- Need a quick health check of the codebase\n\n## Usage\n\nExecute the quality-validator script from the project root:\n\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/quality-validator/scripts/quality-validator.sh <mode>\n```\n\n### Available Modes\n\n#### `quick`\nFast quality check running only linting and type checking. Use for rapid feedback during development.\n\n**Runtime:** ~10-30 seconds\n**Checks:** Linting, Type Safety\n\n**Example:**\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/quality-validator/scripts/quality-validator.sh quick\n```\n\n**Use when:**\n- During active development\n- Quick sanity check\n- Before running full validation\n\n#### `precommit`\nStandard pre-commit validation including linting, types, and tests. Use before any commit.\n\n**Runtime:** ~1-3 minutes\n**Checks:** Linting, Type Safety, Unit Tests\n\n**Example:**\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/quality-validator/scripts/quality-validator.sh precommit\n```\n\n**Use when:**\n- Before creating commits\n- After completing a task\n- Standard workflow validation\n\n#### `full`\nComprehensive quality validation running all quality gates. Use for complete verification.\n\n**Runtime:** ~3-10 minutes\n**Checks:** Linting, Type Safety, Unit Tests, Security Scan, Test Coverage\n\n**Example:**\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/quality-validator/scripts/quality-validator.sh full\n```\n\n**Use when:**\n- Before major releases\n- Quality score verification\n- Complete system health check\n- After significant changes\n- When quality <80 (emergency)\n\n## Quality Gates\n\n### 1. Linting\n**Weight:** 20 points\n**Tools:** ESLint (JavaScript/TypeScript), Pylint (Python)\n**Pass Criteria:** No errors, warnings acceptable\n\n### 2. Type Safety\n**Weight:** 20 points\n**Tools:** TypeScript compiler, mypy (Python)\n**Pass Criteria:** No type errors\n\n### 3. Unit Tests\n**Weight:** 30 points\n**Tools:** Jest, pytest, or project-configured test runner\n**Pass Criteria:** All tests pass\n\n### 4. Security Scan\n**Weight:** 15 points\n**Tools:** npm audit, Safety (Python), snyk\n**Pass Criteria:** Zero high/critical vulnerabilities\n\n### 5. Test Coverage\n**Weight:** 15 points\n**Tools:** Coverage reports from test runners\n**Pass Criteria:** >80% coverage\n\n## Output Format\n\nThe validator outputs:\n1. **Individual Gate Results**: Pass/Fail status for each check\n2. **Quality Score**: 0-100 based on gates passed (weighted)\n3. **Summary**: Overall pass/fail with recommendations\n\n**Example output:**\n```\n\u2713 Linting passed (20/20)\n\u2713 Type Safety passed (20/20)\n\u2713 Unit Tests passed (30/30)\n\u2717 Security Scan failed (0/15) - 2 high vulnerabilities\n\u2713 Test Coverage passed (15/15)\n\nQuality Score: 85/100\nStatus: BELOW THRESHOLD (requires >95)\n```\n\n## Quality Requirements\n\n- **Minimum Score:** 95/100 to proceed\n- **Critical Gates:** Linting, Type Safety, Unit Tests (must all pass)\n- **Emergency Threshold:** 80/100 (STOP and fix if below)\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Run quick during development**: Fast feedback loop\n2. **Run precommit before commits**: Standard validation\n3. **Run full periodically**: Complete health checks\n4. **Fix issues immediately**: Don't accumulate quality debt\n5. **Understand failures**: Read error output, don't just retry\n6. **Update dependencies**: Keep security vulnerabilities low\n\n## Integration with System\n\nThe quality-validator integrates with:\n- Git pre-commit hooks (automatically runs on commit)\n- Continuity cycles (validates before state updates)\n- The /quality-check slash command (manual validation)\n- CI/CD pipelines (automated validation)\n- State metrics (quality score tracked in state)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### No linter configured\nSolution: Add lint script to package.json or install pylint\n\n### Type checking fails\nSolution: Fix TypeScript errors or configure tsconfig.json properly\n\n### Tests fail\nSolution: Run tests individually to identify failing tests\n\n### Security vulnerabilities\nSolution: Run `npm audit fix` or update vulnerable dependencies\n\n### Low coverage\nSolution: Add tests for uncovered code paths\n"

      "content": "---\nname: swarm-deployer\ndescription: This skill should be used when Claude needs to deploy multiple lightweight Haiku-powered agents in parallel for focused tasks like security scanning, code review, data gathering, or parallel research across many files.\n---\n\n# Swarm Deployer\n\nThis skill provides functionality for deploying and managing swarm agents - lightweight, parallel Haiku-powered subagents for focused tasks.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe swarm-deployer skill enables deployment of multiple Haiku agents running concurrently to handle tasks that benefit from parallelization. Each swarm agent is specialized, cost-effective (Haiku model), and designed for focused work.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nUse this skill when:\n- Need to process many files in parallel (security scan 50+ files)\n- Code review across multiple small files simultaneously\n- Data gathering from multiple sources concurrently\n- Parallel research tasks\n- Any task that can be divided into independent subtasks\n- Need fast, cost-effective parallel processing\n\n**Do NOT use when:**\n- Task requires deep reasoning (use full Claude Sonnet instead)\n- Task requires continuity across results (use single agent)\n- Only processing 1-3 files (not worth parallelization overhead)\n\n## Usage\n\nExecute the swarm-deployer script from the project root:\n\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/swarm-deployer/scripts/swarm-deployer.sh <command> [args]\n```\n\n### Available Commands\n\n#### `list`\nDisplay all available swarm templates with their purposes and capabilities.\n\n**Example:**\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/swarm-deployer/scripts/swarm-deployer.sh list\n```\n\n**Output shows:**\n- Template name\n- Purpose description\n- Typical use cases\n\n#### `plan <template-name> <target-pattern>`\nPlan a swarm deployment by showing what files would be processed without actually deploying.\n\n**Arguments:**\n- `template-name`: Name of swarm template to use\n- `target-pattern`: Glob pattern for files to process (e.g., \"src/**/*.js\")\n\n**Example:**\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/swarm-deployer/scripts/swarm-deployer.sh plan security-scanner \"src/**/*.js\"\n```\n\n**Output shows:**\n- Number of agents that would be deployed\n- List of files each agent would process\n- Estimated cost and time\n\n#### `deploy <template-name> <target-pattern>`\nDeploy swarm agents to process files matching the pattern.\n\n**Arguments:**\n- `template-name`: Name of swarm template to use\n- `target-pattern`: Glob pattern for files to process\n\n**Example:**\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/swarm-deployer/scripts/swarm-deployer.sh deploy security-scanner \"src/**/*.js\"\n```\n\n**Process:**\n1. Identifies files matching pattern\n2. Divides files among agents (typically 5-10 files per agent)\n3. Spawns Haiku agents in parallel\n4. Collects results as agents complete\n5. Aggregates results into summary report\n\n#### `history`\nShow history of previous swarm deployments with results.\n\n**Example:**\n```bash\nbash .claude/skills/swarm-deployer/scripts/swarm-deployer.sh history\n```\n\n**Output shows:**\n- Deployment timestamp\n- Template used\n- Number of agents deployed\n- Number of files processed\n- Summary of findings\n\n## Swarm Templates\n\nTemplates are defined in `.claude/subagents/swarm/` directory. Each template is a markdown file defining:\n- **Purpose**: What the swarm does\n- **Task Description**: Instructions for each agent\n- **Output Format**: Expected result structure\n- **Model**: Haiku (lightweight, cost-effective)\n\n### Common Templates\n\n**security-scanner**: Scan files for security vulnerabilities\n**code-reviewer**: Review code quality and best practices\n**documentation-checker**: Verify documentation completeness\n**test-coverage-analyzer**: Analyze test coverage gaps\n**dependency-auditor**: Check dependency versions and vulnerabilities\n\n## Results Storage\n\nSwarm results are stored in `.claude/state/swarm-results/`:\n```\n.claude/state/swarm-results/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 <timestamp>-<template-name>/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 summary.json          # Aggregated results\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 agent-001.json        # Individual agent results\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 agent-002.json\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### When to Use Swarms\n\n**Good use cases:**\n- Security scanning 50 JavaScript files\n- Reviewing 30 small component files\n- Gathering data from 20 API endpoints\n- Analyzing 40 test files for patterns\n\n**Bad use cases:**\n- Processing 3 files (use single agent)\n- Complex refactoring requiring coordination (use Sonnet)\n- Tasks requiring shared state (use single agent)\n\n### Optimization Tips\n\n1. **Batch size**: 5-10 files per agent is optimal\n2. **Pattern specificity**: Use precise globs to avoid processing unnecessary files\n3. **Template selection**: Choose the right template for your task\n4. **Result review**: Always review aggregated results, don't just trust automation\n5. **Cost awareness**: Swarms are cheap but not free - plan deployments\n\n### Creating Custom Templates\n\nTo create a new swarm template:\n\n1. Create file in `.claude/subagents/swarm/<template-name>.md`\n2. Define purpose and task clearly\n3. Specify output format for aggregation\n4. Test with small file set first\n5. Document in template list\n\n**Template structure:**\n```markdown\n**Purpose**: [One sentence describing what this swarm does]\n\n**Model**: claude-3-haiku-20250319\n\n**Task**: [Clear instructions for each agent]\n\n**Output Format**: [JSON structure expected]\n```\n\n## Integration with System\n\nThe swarm-deployer integrates with:\n- The /swarm slash command (easy manual deployment)\n- Continuity cycles (can deploy swarms for automated tasks)\n- Quality validation (can run parallel quality checks)\n- Security monitoring (parallel vulnerability scanning)\n\n## Performance Characteristics\n\n**Speed:** 10-20x faster than sequential processing (depending on file count)\n**Cost:** ~90% cheaper than using Sonnet for same tasks\n**Accuracy:** Suitable for focused tasks; use Sonnet for complex reasoning\n**Concurrency:** Typically 5-15 agents running simultaneously\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### No results returned\nSolution: Check agent logs in results directory, verify template is correct\n\n### Timeout errors\nSolution: Reduce batch size (fewer files per agent)\n\n### Inconsistent results\nSolution: Task may be too complex for Haiku - use Sonnet instead\n\n### High cost\nSolution: Review target pattern - may be processing too many files\n"

      "content": "# Design Philosophy: Aligning Infinity-Claude with Solo Dev Mindset\n\nThis document explains how the infinity-claude autonomous development system follows the principles in `.claude/MINDSET.md`.\n\n---\n\n## Purpose\n\nAt first glance, the infinity-claude system might seem to contradict Solo Dev Mindset principles:\n- It has many features (skills, agents, swarms, continuity cycles)\n- It automates various tasks\n- It has abstractions and structure\n\n**This document reconciles that apparent tension.**\n\n---\n\n## Core Alignment\n\n### MINDSET.md Says: \"Only build what's explicitly requested\"\n**How infinity-claude complies:**\n- The system itself was explicitly requested (you're building an autonomous dev system)\n- Features are tools that wait for invocation, not autonomous actors\n- Skills and agents don't run unless explicitly called via slash commands or state actions\n- The system asks before making decisions (via `requiresHuman` flag)\n\n### MINDSET.md Says: \"No over-engineering\"\n**How infinity-claude complies:**\n- Each feature solves a real, concrete problem:\n  - **State management**: Maintain context across sessions (real need for continuity)\n  - **Quality validation**: Enforce standards before commits (real need for quality)\n  - **Skills**: Reusable scripts to avoid rewriting same code (DRY principle)\n  - **Agents**: Specialized contexts for focused tasks (separation of concerns)\n- No feature exists \"just in case\" or for \"future-proofing\"\n- If you don't use a feature, delete it\n\n### MINDSET.md Says: \"Simplicity and clarity are top priorities\"\n**How infinity-claude complies:**\n- Skills are bash scripts (simple, readable, no magic)\n- State is JSON files (transparent, inspectable, version-controllable)\n- Commands are markdown files (plain text instructions)\n- No hidden databases, no compiled binaries, no proprietary formats\n- You can read every file and understand what it does\n\n### MINDSET.md Says: \"You are not the architect\"\n**How infinity-claude complies:**\n- The continuity-manager subagent plans actions but **always** sets `requiresHuman: true` for architectural changes\n- Agents are tools that execute specs, not decision-makers\n- Skills provide capabilities but don't decide when to use them\n- All automation serves you; you're still the architect\n\n### MINDSET.md Says: \"Reuse, don't reinvent\"\n**How infinity-claude complies:**\n- Uses standard tools: bash, jq, git, npm/pytest for testing\n- Leverages Claude's built-in capabilities instead of custom wrappers\n- Skills wrap existing tools (quality-validator uses eslint/pylint, not custom linters)\n- Only custom code is coordination logic (state management, continuity)\n\n---\n\n## What's Actually Automated\n\n### Automated (No Permission Required)\n- **Quality checks** - Linting, type checking, tests (you want these enforced)\n- **State updates** - Tracking completed actions, incrementing counters\n- **File operations** - Reading state, creating backups before changes\n\n### Semi-Automated (Planned, You Approve)\n- **Next actions** - System suggests, state file shows them, you review\n- **Agent creation** - Interactive wizard asks questions, you provide answers\n- **Swarm deployment** - You invoke slash command, system executes\n\n### Never Automated (Always Asks)\n- **Architectural changes** - Adding new patterns, changing system design\n- **Dependency additions** - Installing new libraries or frameworks\n- **Data model changes** - Modifying state structure or contracts\n- **Git commits** - Only when you explicitly request\n\n---\n\n## Complexity Budget\n\nEvery system has some complexity. The question is: **Is it justified?**\n\n### Justified Complexity \u2705\n- **State files** - Necessary for continuity (you explicitly want autonomous cycles)\n- **Quality gates** - Necessary for maintaining standards (you set score >95 requirement)\n- **Skills structure** - Standard Anthropic pattern (reusing, not reinventing)\n- **Slash commands** - Convenience for repetitive workflows you perform\n\n### Questionable Complexity \u26a0\ufe0f\n*(Features to review and potentially simplify/remove)*\n- **Swarm agents** - Useful for parallel tasks, but complex. Is it used often enough?\n- **Memory files** - Good for context, but might accumulate cruft. Are they maintained?\n- **Multiple subagents** - Do you need continuity-manager AND specialized agents?\n\n### Unjustified Complexity \u274c\n*(Features that should be removed if they exist)*\n- Custom build systems (use npm/make/etc instead)\n- Proprietary state formats (JSON is enough)\n- Abstraction layers over standard tools\n- Features with no current use case\n\n---\n\n## Self-Audit Questions\n\nBefore adding any feature to infinity-claude, ask:\n\n1. **Is it simple?**\n   - Can you explain it in one sentence?\n   - Is the implementation <100 lines for core logic?\n   - Could it be simpler?\n\n2. **Is it lovable?**\n   - Will you actually use this?\n   - Does it save significant time/effort?\n   - Does it bring joy or just \"completeness\"?\n\n3. **Is it complete?**\n   - Does it solve the full problem?\n   - Or is it a half-built \"hook for future use\"?\n   - Can you ship it as-is?\n\n4. **Does it reuse?**\n   - Is there an existing tool/pattern that does this?\n   - Are you rebuilding something standard?\n   - Why not use the standard version?\n\n5. **Did you ask for it?**\n   - Is this in state.json as a next action?\n   - Did you explicitly request this feature?\n   - Or is this \"nice to have\" creep?\n\n**If any answer is NO**, revise or remove the feature.\n\n---\n\n## Guidelines for Future Development\n\n### When Adding Features\n1. **Check MINDSET.md first** - Does this align?\n2. **Ask yourself**: \"Am I building this because it's needed, or because it's interesting?\"\n3. **Start with the simplest version** - No configuration, no options, just core functionality\n4. **Use existing tools** - Wrap, don't rewrite\n5. **Document clearly** - If you can't explain it simply, it's too complex\n\n### When Removing Features\nDon't hesitate to delete:\n- Features you haven't used in 3+ sessions\n- Features that duplicate existing functionality\n- Features that \"might be useful someday\"\n- Features you can't quickly explain to someone else\n\n**Deleting code is improvement, not regression.**\n\n### When Modifying Features\n- Make it simpler, not more capable\n- Remove options, don't add them\n- Reduce abstraction, don't increase it\n- If a feature grows beyond 200 lines, split or simplify\n\n---\n\n## Red Flags (System Violating MINDSET.md)\n\nWatch for these signs that infinity-claude is over-engineering:\n\n\ud83d\udea9 **Creating agents without explicit request**\n- Agents should be created when YOU ask, not proactively\n\n\ud83d\udea9 **Adding \"hooks\" or \"future extensibility\"**\n- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)\n\n\ud83d\udea9 **Building abstractions over simple operations**\n- If a 5-line script becomes a 50-line \"framework\", simplify\n\n\ud83d\udea9 **Automated actions you didn't request**\n- Automation should serve clear, explicit needs\n\n\ud83d\udea9 **Configuration files that control simple behavior**\n- Hardcode defaults, only configure what genuinely varies\n\n\ud83d\udea9 **Features suggested because \"best practices say...\"**\n- Best practices must justify themselves for THIS project\n\nIf you see any of these, **STOP** and review against MINDSET.md.\n\n---\n\n## Success Metrics\n\nThe infinity-claude system is succeeding when:\n\n\u2705 You can explain every feature to someone in <1 minute\n\u2705 You actually use most features regularly\n\u2705 Adding/removing features is trivial (1 file change, no refactoring)\n\u2705 The system helps you ship faster, not think harder\n\u2705 You feel in control, not automated away\n\u2705 New Claude instances can understand the system by reading a few files\n\nThe infinity-claude system is failing when:\n\n\u274c You're not sure what some features do\n\u274c Features exist \"just in case\"\n\u274c Changes require coordination across many files\n\u274c You spend more time configuring than building\n\u274c The system makes decisions you don't understand\n\u274c Documentation is longer than the code\n\n---\n\n## Final Note\n\n**The infinity-claude system is a power tool, not a magic wand.**\n\nLike a good power drill:\n- It has focused capabilities (skills, agents, state)\n- You control when and how to use it (slash commands, explicit invocation)\n- It's transparent (you can see how it works)\n- It saves time on repetitive tasks (continuity, quality checks)\n- But **you're still the carpenter** - it doesn't build the house for you\n\nWhen the system tries to be an architect instead of a tool, refer back to MINDSET.md and simplify.\n\n**Own the system. Don't let it own you.**\n"

State Management (`.claude/state/current.json`)\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned\n**Reason**:\n- Solves explicit need (continuity across sessions)\n- Simple JSON format (transparent, inspectable)\n- Required for autonomous cycles (you explicitly want this)\n- No abstraction - just read/write JSON\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep as-is\n\n### 2. State Manager Skill\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned\n**Reason**:\n- Simple bash script wrapping jq commands\n- Prevents manual JSON editing errors\n- Every function is understandable at a glance\n- Reuses existing tool (jq) instead of custom parser\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep as-is\n\n### 3. Quality Validator Skill\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned\n**Reason**:\n- Enforces standards you explicitly set (score >95)\n- Reuses standard tools (eslint, pylint, jest, pytest)\n- No custom validation logic, just orchestration\n- Solves real need (prevent bad code from being committed)\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep as-is\n\n### 4. Slash Commands\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned\n**Reason**:\n- Simple markdown files with instructions\n- Convenience for workflows you perform repeatedly\n- Easy to add/remove (just a .md file)\n- No magic - Claude reads and follows instructions\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep as-is\n\n### 5. Agent Spawner Skill\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned\n**Reason**:\n- Interactive wizard (asks questions, you answer)\n- Creates simple agent.md files\n- Validates naming to prevent errors\n- Only runs when you explicitly invoke it\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep as-is\n\n### 6. Skills Structure (Anthropic Standard)\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned\n**Reason**:\n- Reuses proven pattern (not reinventing)\n- Simple: SKILL.md + scripts folder\n- Transparent - all files readable\n- Follows \"Reuse, Don't Reinvent\" principle\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep as-is\n\n### 7. Git Integration\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned\n**Reason**:\n- Uses standard git commands\n- Only commits when you explicitly request\n- No custom wrappers or abstractions\n- Safety checks (don't commit secrets, etc.)\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep as-is\n\n### 8. Quality Gates (score thresholds)\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned\n**Reason**:\n- You set the standards (>95, >80% coverage)\n- Prevents shipping broken code (real need)\n- Simple scoring: weighted sum of pass/fail\n- Transparent - you can see exactly why score is X\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep as-is\n\n### 9. Continuity Manager Subagent\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned\n**Reason**:\n- Focused purpose (update state between cycles)\n- Sets `requiresHuman: true` for big decisions\n- Markdown file with clear instructions\n- No hidden logic or autonomous decision-making\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep as-is\n\n### 10. Memory Files (`.claude/memory/`)\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned (with caveat)\n**Reason**:\n- Simple markdown files\n- Help maintain context across sessions\n- No proprietary format\n- Easy to edit/delete\n\n**Caveat**: Can accumulate cruft - audit periodically\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep, but review quarterly for relevance\n\n### 11. Bash Skills (vs custom tooling)\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned\n**Reason**:\n- Uses standard Unix tools (bash, jq, grep, find)\n- No custom binaries or compiled code\n- Readable by any dev familiar with shell scripting\n- Follows \"Reuse, Don't Reinvent\"\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep as-is\n\n### 12. SKILL.md Documentation\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned\n**Reason**:\n- Plain markdown (simple, readable)\n- Explains purpose and usage clearly\n- No over-documentation (focused on essentials)\n- Helps you understand what tools you have\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep as-is\n\n### 13. JSON State Format\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned\n**Reason**:\n- Standard format (not proprietary)\n- Human-readable and editable\n- Version-controllable with git\n- Works with standard tools (jq, editors, scripts)\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep as-is\n\n### 14. Skill Creator (Anthropic official)\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned\n**Reason**:\n- Official Anthropic tool (not custom invention)\n- Helps create properly structured skills\n- Prevents reinventing skill structure\n- Follows \"Reuse\" principle\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep as-is\n\n### 15. README.md\n**Status**: \u2705 Aligned\n**Reason**:\n- Standard project documentation\n- Explains what the system is/does\n- Helps future-you understand the project\n- No over-documentation\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep as-is\n\n---\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Questionable Features\n\nThese features might need simplification or better justification:\n\n### 1. Swarm Deployer Skill\n**Status**: \u26a0\ufe0f Questionable\n**Issues**:\n- Complex feature (parallel Haiku agents)\n- Adds significant conceptual overhead\n- Might be premature optimization\n\n**Questions to answer**:\n- Have you actually used swarms more than once?\n- Could you achieve same results with simpler sequential processing?\n- Is the complexity worth the speed gain?\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- **If used regularly**: Keep but document concrete use cases\n- **If rarely used**: Remove and recreate when genuinely needed\n- **If never used**: Delete immediately\n\n### 2. Multiple Subagent Files\n**Status**: \u26a0\ufe0f Questionable\n**Issues**:\n- How many subagents exist?\n- Are they all actively used?\n- Is there overlap in responsibilities?\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- Audit `.claude/subagents/` directory\n- Delete any subagent not used in last 5 sessions\n- Consider consolidating overlapping subagents\n\n### 3. Swarm Templates (`.claude/subagents/swarm/`)\n**Status**: \u26a0\ufe0f Questionable\n**Issues**:\n- Are these templates actually used?\n- Do they follow MINDSET.md (or are they speculative)?\n- Are they maintained or outdated?\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- Delete unused templates\n- Only keep templates with proven use cases\n- Create new ones only when needed (not preemptively)\n\n### 4. History Files (`.claude/state/history.jsonl`)\n**Status**: \u26a0\ufe0f Questionable\n**Issues**:\n- Is history actually reviewed?\n- Does it accumulate noise over time?\n- Is it necessary for continuity or just \"nice to have\"?\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- **If used for debugging**: Keep with size limits (rolling window)\n- **If never reviewed**: Delete - state file is sufficient\n\n### 5. `.claude/agents/` Runtime Agents\n**Status**: \u26a0\ufe0f Questionable\n**Issues**:\n- Are these created automatically or manually?\n- How many exist?\n- Are they cleaned up after use?\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- Audit directory - delete stale agents\n- Only create agents when explicitly needed\n- Add cleanup mechanism (delete agents older than N days)\n\n### 6. Multiple Documentation Files\n**Status**: \u26a0\ufe0f Questionable\n**Issues**:\n- `.claude/docs/` has many files\n- Is there duplication between docs?\n- Are all docs current and accurate?\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- Consolidate overlapping docs\n- Delete outdated docs\n- Keep only: quick-start.md, quality-framework.md, design-philosophy.md\n\n---\n\n## \u274c Violations\n\nThese features violate MINDSET.md and should be simplified/removed:\n\n### 1. Automated 30-Minute Cycles (if implemented)\n**Status**: \u274c Violation\n**Issues**:\n- MINDSET.md says \"Only build what explicitly asked for\"\n- Autonomous cycles without approval violate \"You Are Not the Architect\"\n- Could make changes you don't want\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- **If automated cycles are running**: DISABLE immediately\n- **If just planned**: Keep as manual `/continue` only\n- Autonomous cycles should require explicit enable flag + very clear boundaries\n\n**Exception**: If cycles only read/analyze (never write), and you explicitly want this, then okay\n\n### 2. Any \"Future Hooks\" or Unused Abstract Patterns\n**Status**: \u274c Violation\n**Issues**:\n- MINDSET.md explicitly forbids \"future proofing\"\n- Empty functions/classes/interfaces waiting to be filled\n- Abstraction layers with only one implementation\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- Search codebase for TODO comments\n- Delete any \"hooks for future features\"\n- Remove abstractions used in only one place\n- Simplify to concrete, working code only\n\n---\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Immediate (Do Now)\n1. \u2705 Move MINDSET.md to `.claude/` (already done)\n2. \u2705 Add supremacy clause to MINDSET.md (already done)\n3. \u2705 Update CLAUDE.md header (already done)\n4. \u2705 Create design-philosophy.md (already done)\n5. \u274c **Verify**: Are automated 30-min cycles running? If yes, disable.\n6. \u274c **Audit**: Check for TODO comments and future hooks \u2192 Delete\n\n### Short Term (This Week)\n1. Review `.claude/subagents/` - delete unused subagents\n2. Review `.claude/docs/` - consolidate overlapping docs\n3. Audit swarm-deployer - justify or remove\n4. Check `.claude/agents/` - add cleanup if needed\n5. Review memory files - delete stale content\n\n### Ongoing (Each Session)\n1. Before adding feature: Check MINDSET.md compliance\n2. After completing task: Delete any temporary files/agents\n3. Weekly: Review state file for cruft\n4. Monthly: Re-audit system against MINDSET.md\n\n---\n\n## Compliance Checklist\n\nBefore adding any new feature, verify:\n\n- [ ] Feature solves explicit, current need (not hypothetical)\n- [ ] Implementation is simplest possible version\n- [ ] Uses existing tools where available (doesn't reinvent)\n- [ ] Code is <200 lines and understandable at a glance\n- [ ] No abstractions unless used 3+ places\n- [ ] No configuration files for simple behavior\n- [ ] Feature can be deleted in <5 minutes if not needed\n- [ ] You can explain it to someone in <1 minute\n- [ ] It aligns with SLC (Simple, Lovable, Complete)\n\n**If any checkbox is unchecked, don't build the feature.**\n\n---\n\n## Review Schedule\n\n- **Daily**: Check for accumulating cruft (temp files, logs)\n- **Weekly**: Review new features against MINDSET.md\n- **Monthly**: Full system audit using this checklist\n- **Quarterly**: Memory file review and cleanup\n\nNext scheduled audit: 2025-11-28\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\nThis audit is a living document. Update it as:\n- New features are added\n- Features are removed\n- Violations are discovered\n- System evolves\n\n**Remember**: The goal isn't perfection, it's maintaining Solo Dev Mindset principles while building useful tools.\n"
