# System Audit: MINDSET.md Compliance

This document audits all features in the infinity-claude system against `.claude/MINDSET.md` principles.

**Audit Date**: 2025-10-28
**Auditor**: System review against Solo Dev Mindset principles

---

## Audit Results Summary

- ✅ **Aligned**: 15 features
- ⚠️ **Questionable**: 6 features (review recommended)
- ❌ **Violations**: 2 features (simplify or remove)

---

## ✅ Aligned Features

These features comply with MINDSET.md principles:

### 1. State Management (`.claude/state/current.json`)
**Status**: ✅ Aligned
**Reason**:
- Solves explicit need (continuity across sessions)
- Simple JSON format (transparent, inspectable)
- Required for autonomous cycles (you explicitly want this)
- No abstraction - just read/write JSON

**Recommendation**: Keep as-is

### 2. State Manager Skill
**Status**: ✅ Aligned
**Reason**:
- Simple bash script wrapping jq commands
- Prevents manual JSON editing errors
- Every function is understandable at a glance
- Reuses existing tool (jq) instead of custom parser

**Recommendation**: Keep as-is

### 3. Quality Validator Skill
**Status**: ✅ Aligned
**Reason**:
- Enforces standards you explicitly set (score >95)
- Reuses standard tools (eslint, pylint, jest, pytest)
- No custom validation logic, just orchestration
- Solves real need (prevent bad code from being committed)

**Recommendation**: Keep as-is

### 4. Slash Commands
**Status**: ✅ Aligned
**Reason**:
- Simple markdown files with instructions
- Convenience for workflows you perform repeatedly
- Easy to add/remove (just a .md file)
- No magic - Claude reads and follows instructions

**Recommendation**: Keep as-is

### 5. Agent Spawner Skill
**Status**: ✅ Aligned
**Reason**:
- Interactive wizard (asks questions, you answer)
- Creates simple agent.md files
- Validates naming to prevent errors
- Only runs when you explicitly invoke it

**Recommendation**: Keep as-is

### 6. Skills Structure (Anthropic Standard)
**Status**: ✅ Aligned
**Reason**:
- Reuses proven pattern (not reinventing)
- Simple: SKILL.md + scripts folder
- Transparent - all files readable
- Follows "Reuse, Don't Reinvent" principle

**Recommendation**: Keep as-is

### 7. Git Integration
**Status**: ✅ Aligned
**Reason**:
- Uses standard git commands
- Only commits when you explicitly request
- No custom wrappers or abstractions
- Safety checks (don't commit secrets, etc.)

**Recommendation**: Keep as-is

### 8. Quality Gates (score thresholds)
**Status**: ✅ Aligned
**Reason**:
- You set the standards (>95, >80% coverage)
- Prevents shipping broken code (real need)
- Simple scoring: weighted sum of pass/fail
- Transparent - you can see exactly why score is X

**Recommendation**: Keep as-is

### 9. Continuity Manager Subagent
**Status**: ✅ Aligned
**Reason**:
- Focused purpose (update state between cycles)
- Sets `requiresHuman: true` for big decisions
- Markdown file with clear instructions
- No hidden logic or autonomous decision-making

**Recommendation**: Keep as-is

### 10. Memory Files (`.claude/memory/`)
**Status**: ✅ Aligned (with caveat)
**Reason**:
- Simple markdown files
- Help maintain context across sessions
- No proprietary format
- Easy to edit/delete

**Caveat**: Can accumulate cruft - audit periodically

**Recommendation**: Keep, but review quarterly for relevance

### 11. Bash Skills (vs custom tooling)
**Status**: ✅ Aligned
**Reason**:
- Uses standard Unix tools (bash, jq, grep, find)
- No custom binaries or compiled code
- Readable by any dev familiar with shell scripting
- Follows "Reuse, Don't Reinvent"

**Recommendation**: Keep as-is

### 12. SKILL.md Documentation
**Status**: ✅ Aligned
**Reason**:
- Plain markdown (simple, readable)
- Explains purpose and usage clearly
- No over-documentation (focused on essentials)
- Helps you understand what tools you have

**Recommendation**: Keep as-is

### 13. JSON State Format
**Status**: ✅ Aligned
**Reason**:
- Standard format (not proprietary)
- Human-readable and editable
- Version-controllable with git
- Works with standard tools (jq, editors, scripts)

**Recommendation**: Keep as-is

### 14. Skill Creator (Anthropic official)
**Status**: ✅ Aligned
**Reason**:
- Official Anthropic tool (not custom invention)
- Helps create properly structured skills
- Prevents reinventing skill structure
- Follows "Reuse" principle

**Recommendation**: Keep as-is

### 15. README.md
**Status**: ✅ Aligned
**Reason**:
- Standard project documentation
- Explains what the system is/does
- Helps future-you understand the project
- No over-documentation

**Recommendation**: Keep as-is

## ⚠️ Questionable Features

These features might need simplification or better justification:

### 1. Swarm Deployer Skill
**Status**: ⚠️ Questionable
**Issues**:
- Complex feature (parallel Haiku agents)
- Adds significant conceptual overhead
- Might be premature optimization

**Questions to answer**:
- Have you actually used swarms more than once?
- Could you achieve same results with simpler sequential processing?
- Is the complexity worth the speed gain?

**Recommendation**:
- **If used regularly**: Keep but document concrete use cases
- **If rarely used**: Remove and recreate when genuinely needed
- **If never used**: Delete immediately

### 2. Multiple Subagent Files
**Status**: ⚠️ Questionable
**Issues**:
- How many subagents exist?
- Are they all actively used?
- Is there overlap in responsibilities?

**Recommendation**:
- Audit `.claude/subagents/` directory
- Delete any subagent not used in last 5 sessions
- Consider consolidating overlapping subagents

### 3. Swarm Templates (`.claude/subagents/swarm/`)
**Status**: ⚠️ Questionable
**Issues**:
- Are these templates actually used?
- Do they follow MINDSET.md (or are they speculative)?
- Are they maintained or outdated?

**Recommendation**:
- Delete unused templates
- Only keep templates with proven use cases
- Create new ones only when needed (not preemptively)

### 4. History Files (`.claude/state/history.jsonl`)
**Status**: ⚠️ Questionable
**Issues**:
- Is history actually reviewed?
- Does it accumulate noise over time?
- Is it necessary for continuity or just "nice to have"?

**Recommendation**:
- **If used for debugging**: Keep with size limits (rolling window)
- **If never reviewed**: Delete - state file is sufficient

### 5. `.claude/agents/` Runtime Agents
**Status**: ⚠️ Questionable
**Issues**:
- Are these created automatically or manually?
- How many exist?
- Are they cleaned up after use?

**Recommendation**:
- Audit directory - delete stale agents
- Only create agents when explicitly needed
- Add cleanup mechanism (delete agents older than N days)

### 6. Multiple Documentation Files
**Status**: ⚠️ Questionable
**Issues**:
- `.claude/docs/` has many files
- Is there duplication between docs?
- Are all docs current and accurate?

**Recommendation**:
- Consolidate overlapping docs
- Delete outdated docs
- Keep only: quick-start.md, quality-framework.md, design-philosophy.md

## ❌ Violations

These features violate MINDSET.md and should be simplified/removed:

### 1. Automated 30-Minute Cycles (if implemented)
**Status**: ❌ Violation
**Issues**:
- MINDSET.md says "Only build what explicitly asked for"
- Autonomous cycles without approval violate "You Are Not the Architect"
- Could make changes you don't want

**Recommendation**:
- **If automated cycles are running**: DISABLE immediately
- **If just planned**: Keep as manual `/continue` only
- Autonomous cycles should require explicit enable flag + very clear boundaries

**Exception**: If cycles only read/analyze (never write), and you explicitly want this, then okay

### 2. Any "Future Hooks" or Unused Abstract Patterns
**Status**: ❌ Violation
**Issues**:
- MINDSET.md explicitly forbids "future proofing"
- Empty functions/classes/interfaces waiting to be filled
- Abstraction layers with only one implementation

**Recommendation**:
- Search codebase for TODO comments
- Delete any "hooks for future features"
- Remove abstractions used in only one place
- Simplify to concrete, working code only

## Action Items

### Immediate (Do Now)
1. ✅ Move MINDSET.md to `.claude/` (already done)
2. ✅ Add supremacy clause to MINDSET.md (already done)
3. ✅ Update CLAUDE.md header (already done)
4. ✅ Create design-philosophy.md (already done)
5. ❌ **Verify**: Are automated 30-min cycles running? If yes, disable.
6. ❌ **Audit**: Check for TODO comments and future hooks → Delete

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Review `.claude/subagents/` - delete unused subagents
2. Review `.claude/docs/` - consolidate overlapping docs
3. Audit swarm-deployer - justify or remove
4. Check `.claude/agents/` - add cleanup if needed
5. Review memory files - delete stale content

### Ongoing (Each Session)
1. Before adding feature: Check MINDSET.md compliance
2. After completing task: Delete any temporary files/agents
3. Weekly: Review state file for cruft
4. Monthly: Re-audit system against MINDSET.md
