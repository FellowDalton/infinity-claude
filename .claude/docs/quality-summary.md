# Quality-First Development System

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**Every line of code must meet industry best practices. No exceptions.**

This autonomous system is built around one critical principle: **quality over speed**. Claude has internet access and uses it aggressively to research, validate, and enforce the highest standards.

---

## 🔍 How Quality is Enforced

### 1. Research Before Code
```
BEFORE writing any code:
1. Search: "[technology] best practices 2025"
2. Study: Top GitHub projects in the domain
3. Read: Official style guides and documentation
4. Document: Findings in .claude/memory/best-practices.md
5. THEN: Write code following those practices
```

### 2. Automated Quality Gates
```bash
# Every piece of code must pass:
✓ Linting (zero warnings)
✓ Type checking (full coverage)
✓ Tests (>80% coverage)
✓ Security scan (no vulnerabilities)
✓ Code review (automated)
✓ Performance check (benchmarks met)
✓ Documentation (complete)

# Run all at once:
bash .claude/scripts/run_quality_gates.sh
```

### 3. Self-Improving System
```
Each cycle:
1. Run quality gates
2. Search: "better way to [what was done]"
3. Compare: Current approach vs. best practices
4. Update: Quality standards as needed
5. Refactor: If improvements found
6. Document: Learnings in memory
```

## 📊 Quality Metrics

### Tracked Automatically
```json
{
  "qualityScore": 98,        // Target: >95
  "testCoverage": 87,        // Target: >80%
  "linterPasses": 145,
  "securityScans": 23,
  "codeReviews": 56,
  "performanceTests": 12,
  "bestPracticeViolations": 0  // Target: 0
}
```

### Quality Score Calculation
```
Base: 100 points
- Linter warnings: -1 each
- Test gaps: -10 per 10% below 80%
- Security issues: -10 each
- Best practice violations: -10 each
- Performance failures: -5 each

Minimum to proceed: 95/100
```

## 🚨 Critical Rules

### Red Flags (Auto-Block)
```
❌ Code without tests
❌ Test coverage <80%
❌ Any security vulnerabilities
❌ Linter errors (warnings may be acceptable)
❌ Hardcoded secrets
❌ Functions >50 lines
❌ Complexity >10
❌ Copy-pasted code
❌ Uncaught exceptions
❌ Missing documentation
```

### When to Block Progress
```
IF qualityScore < 95:
    1. STOP all development
    2. Document issues in blockers
    3. Fix all issues
    4. Re-run quality gates
    5. Only proceed when score >95

IF stuck for 3+ cycles:
    1. Create helper agent
    2. Research alternative approaches
    3. Update quality standards
    4. Try again
```

## 📖 How Claude Uses This

### Cycle 1-5: Setup Quality Infrastructure
```bash
# Claude creates:
1. quality_enforcer agent
2. Linting configuration
3. Testing framework
4. Security scanning
5. Quality documentation
```

### Cycle 6+: Continuous Validation
```bash
# Every cycle:
1. Research best practices (if new tech)
2. Write code following practices
3. Run quality gates: bash .claude/scripts/run_quality_gates.sh
4. If fails: Fix and retry
5. If passes: Commit and continue
6. Update quality metrics in state
7. Document learnings
```

### Example Web Search Queries
```
# Before choosing React:
"React vs Vue vs Svelte 2025 comparison"
"React best practices 2025"
"React common mistakes"
"React performance optimization"
"React security best practices"

# Before implementing auth:
"authentication best practices 2025"
"JWT vs session authentication"
"password hashing standards"
"OWASP authentication checklist"

# Before database design:
"PostgreSQL schema design best practices"
"database indexing strategies"
"SQL injection prevention"
"database security checklist"
```

## 🎓 Learning & Improvement

### After Each Quality Gate Run
```markdown
1. What violations occurred?
2. Why did they happen?
3. How to prevent in future?
4. Update quality rules
5. Document in learnings.md
```

### Monthly Quality Review
```bash
# Claude should periodically:
1. Review all quality metrics
2. Search for "latest [tech] best practices"
3. Compare current code vs. new standards
4. Plan refactoring if needed
5. Update documentation
```

## 📞 When to Request Human Help

```
Set requiresHuman: true if:
- Quality score <80 for 3+ cycles
- Cannot find best practices for a technology
- Security vulnerabilities can't be fixed
- Unclear which approach meets best practices
- Major architectural decision needed
- Quality gates consistently failing
```

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Quality is not a feature. It's the foundation.**

- Research first, code second
- Validate everything automatically
- Block bad code ruthlessly
- Learn and improve continuously
- Document all decisions
- Never compromise on standards

**Your code should be exemplary. No exceptions.**
